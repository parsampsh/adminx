## Get started
To get started with this package, do the following steps in your laravel project:

- Add the package via composer: `$ composer require parsampsh/adminx`
- Publish public assets: `$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Adminx\AdminxServiceProvider"`
- Run the migrations: `$ php artisan migrate`

Then, adminx is ready to be used. create `routes/adminx.php` file and go to `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` and include that in **End of the `boot` method**:

```php
// ...

include base_path('routes/adminx.php');

// ...
```

Then, write this code in `routes/adminx.php`:

```php
// ...

$admin = new \Adminx\Core;

// set the admin panel configurations on $admin object

// register the admin panel
$admin->register('/admin'); // `/admin` is the route of admin panel

// ...
```

Now, run `$ php artisan optimize`, `$ php artisan serve` and goto `/admin` page. Remember that to access to the admin panel you must be logged in using the laravel auth.

Enjoy it!
