# General configuration
Adminx has some general configurations.

### Admin panel title
You can set title of your admin panel.

```php
$admin = new \Adminx\Core;

$admin->set_title('My admin panel');

// this methods returns the title
$admin->get_title();
```

now, you can see this title in the admin panel.

### The Footer Copyright message
You can set the footer copyright message.

```php
$admin->set_copyright('All rights reserved.');

// this methods returns the copyright
$admin->get_copyright();
```

now, you can see this copyright message at the footer of admin panel.

### Access middleware
The important question is that **Who can access to the admin panel?**

to set that which users can access to the admin panel, you can use `set_middleware` method.

```php
$admin->set_middleware(function(){
    // check some conditions and return a boolean
    return true;
});

$admin->set_middleware(function($user){
    // the logged in user is in $user. we can check conditions on thsi
    // for example
    return $user->access_level === 'manager' || $user->access_level === 'admin';
});
```

This method gets a `Closure` and runs that and passes the current user as argument to that(you can don't set the argument and that is optional), then, if return value of function is `true`, means access is allowed for that user.

By default, if you don't set this middleware, default value is `true`.

also you can check this middleware manually:

```php
$result = $admin->run_middleware();
var_dump($result); // true or false
```

### Logout url of user
The adminx panel, has a logout button. you can set the link of that button to logout user.

```php
$admin->set_logout('/user/logout');

// you can get the link with this method
$admin->get_logout();
```

default value for this item is `/auth/logout`.

### User info
In the adminx panel, in top right is user information: Username and image.

you can set value of them by using `set_userinfo` method.

```php
$admin->set_userinfo(function($user){
    return [
        'username' => $user->name,
        'image' => '/link/to/user/images/' . $user->img,
    ];
});
```

this method gets closure and passes user object to that(`$user` argument is optional) and this closure should return a dictonary contains two keys: `username` and `image`. the `username` will be showed as username of user and `image` will be used as user profile image link.

also you can get user info by using `get_userinfo` method.

```php
$user_info = $admin->get_userinfo();
var_dump($user_info); // {'username' => '...', 'image' => '...'}
```

## An Example

```php
$admin = new \Adminx\Core;

$admin
    ->set_title('My admin panel')
    ->set_copyright('All rights reserved')
    ->set_logout('/auth/logout')
    ->set_userinfo(function($user){
        return [
            'username' => $user->username
        ];
    })
    ->register('/admin');

```
